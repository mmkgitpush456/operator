Welcome to the biggest operation ever (or at least I'd like to believe it is).

The concept of 'Operator' is very simple.  Simply press down on 1 of the gray crossbars or on the intersecting operator and move either horizontally and/or vertically.  Have the center operator dodge incoming sliders of different colors and hit sliders of matching color to increase your score.

See how many levels you can clear by dodging and hitting the right sliders.  When the timer at the upper left strikes 00:00, you move on to the next level.  Just be wary that as you level up, the sliders speed up and begin to generate at a faster pace.  

When your game is over and you run out of lives, you can enter your high score to track your progress Operator wizardry over time.

Thanks for downloading and enjoy the operation!!
